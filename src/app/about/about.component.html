          <p>This portfolio is designed to showcase the breadth and scope of my skill-set. It is built using Angular 6.x for populating and displaying my work in the Projects menu on the left sidebar. I will add more functionality 
            as time allows. 
          </p>
  
          <p>Since this portfolio is technically still in development consider yourself a bonafide tester. As such, you may feel free 
            to navigate freely throughout the site and email me if you encounter any bugs.
